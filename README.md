# Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection & Monitoring System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection & Monitoring System** is an enterprise-grade streaming analytics platform designed to **detect, score, and monitor suspicious financial transactions in real time** using modern data engineering and machine learning practices.

The system leverages **Databricks Structured Streaming**, **Delta Lake Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold)**, and **ML-based anomaly detection** to deliver **low-latency fraud insights** and **interactive dashboards** for operational and strategic decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Financial institutions process millions of transactions per day and must:

* Detect fraud in real time
* Minimize financial losses
* Reduce false positives
* Maintain transparency and auditability

Traditional batch-only systems fail to respond quickly to evolving fraud patterns.

### ✅ Our Solution

A **fully streaming, ML-powered fraud detection system** that:

* Ingests live transaction data
* Scores transactions using anomaly detection
* Surfaces fraud trends and alerts in real time
* Enables rapid investigation and response

> Note : how isolation forest works ?
> Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed specifically for anomaly detection. Unlike most methods that profile "normal" data to find deviations, Isolation Forest explicitly isolates anomalies by exploiting their inherent properties: they are few and different. 

Core Mechanism: Isolation through Partitioning 
The algorithm works by separating data points using a series of random recursive splits. 

Step 1: Random Splitting: The algorithm selects a random feature from the dataset and a random split value between that feature’s minimum and maximum values.
Step 2: Recursive Partitioning: This process is repeated until every data point is isolated in its own "leaf" or a specific tree height is reached.
Step 3: Path Length: For each point, the algorithm measures the path length—the number of splits required to isolate it.
Anomalies are rare and located in sparse regions, so they typically require fewer splits (shorter paths) to isolate.
Normal points are clustered together and require many more splits (longer paths).
